<PropertyList><!-- Iraqi Airways 747-400 Livery by E-Savageair....


Iraqi Airways was founded as a department of the Iraqi State Railways in 1945.  On January 28, 1946 the airline started operations with five British-built De Havilland Dragon Rapides on service to Syria.  The new airline then ordered three Vickers Viking aircraft with cooperation with
the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and leased four Douglas
DC-3's in Decemeber while waiting for the new aircraft to arrive. The
next year Iraqi Airways replaced the Dragon Rapides with De Havilland Doves in October 1947, with the order of three new Vikings with one leased second-hand.-

In July 1953 Iraqi Airways went bigger with the four-engine Vickers
Viscount and replaced the Vikings.  The Viscounts covered the new long
routes to London with stops between.  In 1960 the airline became 
independent from the railroad and flew into the jet age, placing an order for two Boeing 720B's for 1964, but that order soon was cancelled.  Still the airline bought Russian Tupolev Tu-124's and British Hawker-Siddley 
Trident jets for flights across the Middle East, Africa, and Europe.
By the 70's Iraqi needed even bigger jets to fly into John F. Kennedy
International Airport, and purchased the Boeing 707; when more passengers
filled the planes quickly, they purchased the Boeing 747.-

Then in the 80's, the game changed: Saddam Hussein rose to power.  The
Islamic Revolution in Iran, the Amercians being held hostage there, and
the Ayatollah Khomeini's own rise pressed Saddam into war with Iran.  With the backing of Eurpoean, Arab, and American economic and military
support, Saddam was able to take the fight to the emeny by keeping an
revolutionary Iran in check.  In doing so, Hussein's allies were lead to
declare him, "The Defender of the Arab World".  However by 1988, the war
against Iran had left Iraq almost broke and by then Saddam's regime had turned to thuggery.  To keep his hold on power, Hussein began to wield a iron fist through purges and torture.  When the Kurds rose against Saddam's regime, by trying to trigger a coup, he commited genocide by using chemical warfare as he did during the war on Iran, killing thousands.  Hussein had violated international laws to keep him in power, but it was largely ignored by his allies.-

Still Saddam reached out to borrow from other Arab governments for cash
support.  While there was financial backing for the war with Iran, it left little for postwar reconstruction. That's when Hussein turned to Kuwait, urging them to grant the concessions to rebuild his infrastucture.  However when they refused his demands, and believing that they were historically a part of Iraq, Saddam invaded Kuwait on August 1, 1990. It lead the United Nations to putting sanctions against Iraq; among them, a ban on Iraqi Airways.  In addition, the U.S. government accused the airline of being a front company and banned all Americans from the airline.  Iraqi Airways had 17 jetliners which were moved to secret 
locations in Jordan.  Two of them, Boeing 747's, one of them believing
to be Saddam's private plane were flown to Tunisia.  On January 17, 1991, when the deadline passed for Hussein's forces to leave Kuwait but
still occupied the country, the United States decleared war on Iraq,
commencing "Operation Desert Storm".-

In May 1991 after the war, domestic flights were permitted by the UN
using helicopters since fixed wing aircraft were still banned under ceasefire agreements.  Soon the UN Security Council agrees to resumption
of flights, starting in January 1992 from Baghdad to Basra using Antonov
An-24 aircraft.  The operations were suspended though after a UN ruling.
Those were lean years for Iraqi Airways, only operating a few pilgrim
flights to Muslim sites because of "No Fly Zones" imposed by the United States and the United Kingdom througout the 90's.  Then on March 30, 2003
in response to the September 11th attacks, concerns of Iraq's "weapons of mass destruction", and using them in future attacks as rumored by Russia's Vladimir Putin, the U.S. commenced "Operation Iraqi Freedom" to overthrow Saddam Hussein as a part of the "Global War on Terrorism".-

On May 30th, 2003 Iraqi Airways announced plans resume international 
flights after Baghdad fell, and the name was transferred to a new company
to prevent legal problems caused by Saddam's regime.  The first flight
operations began on October 3, 2004 with a flight from Baghdad to Amman.
Then on June 4th, 2005 was the first commerical service from Baghdad
to Basra since the fall of Saddam. It was followed five months
later with the first flight to Tehran, Iran in twenty-five years.  The new Iraqi Airways contiuned to grow with more flights, signing a $2.2
billion contract with Boeing for thirty 737-800's in 2008. However when the Iraqi government purchased Bombardier aircraft, Kuwait Airways sued Bombardier stating Iraqi Airways still owed $1.2 billion to Kuwait from the Gulf War. However, the Canadian judge couldn't rule against Iraqi Airways since the purchase of aircraft was from a government, not an airline.  Iraq in the end paid a settlement of $300 million to Kuwait.- 

By 2010, Iraqi Airways was now flying more into Europe, flying into 
Denmark, Germany, Turkey, Mumbai or Delhi. Now Airbus aircraft were added to the fleet like A330's and A320's. New flights were added, going into the Middle East, Moscow, Belarus, China, and after a 22-year hiatus resumed flights to Kuwait.  Soon the U.S. helped Iraqi get further ahead with bank loans of $2 billion dollars.  Now the airline was buying Boeing 777's and was on the list for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliners. But as the saying goes, "more money, more troubles". Once in 2010 a Kuwaiti lawyer seized an Iraqi 737-400 owned by a Swedish company Tor Air with the General director on board, demanding a billion dollars for stolen aircraft during the 1990 invasion on Kuwait.  Another time in 2015 Swedish Aerospace once banned Iraqi Airways for not meeting safety standards required to fly in the EU; this time it was bureaucracy, not reparations from war.  Each time Iraqi Airways found ways to resolve issues.  In this case they leased aircraft from Dubai-based Aerovista, and operated through another company, AirExplore.

Through it all, Iraqi Airways has survived the worse that can be thrown at an airline: war, sanctions, lawsuits, bans, and bureaucracy.  Headquartered at the now renamed Baghdad International Airport, the government-owned airline flies to Basra, Al Najaf, Sulaymaniyah, Erbil international airports, and to 38 destinations. It has 33 aircraft, is a member of the Arab Air Carrier Organization, and is the oldest airline in the Middle East.-

In 2008, Iraqi Airways tried a new blue paint scheme, a change from the green shade livery. Bombardier aircraft used the livery, but one 
went back the green shade.  Then in 2012, Iraqi updated the 70's era 
livery by interacting the two shades of green with white trim around the airline's logo at the tail, ending near the nose in a racecar, stripe-like cheatline. The name "Iraqi Airways" appears in arabic on one side, and english on the opposite side on the front section of the aircraft, using almost the same bold, block-type fonts as in the previous livery.  This is the paint scheme applied to the fleet and is the subject repaint.-

Also included in the fleet are two Boeing 747-400's.  The first '400 was 
received on October 2010, the other arrived on April 2013. The second
plane is of mention: registered as YI-ASA, this aircarft was ex-Malaysia
9M-MPO named "Alor Setar", delivered to Malaysia Airlines on Decemeber
2001, and is a livery repaint for the Boeing 747-400 in FlightGear (also done by yours truly!- www.flightgear.liveries.org)....-
